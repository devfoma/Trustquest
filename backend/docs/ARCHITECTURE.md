# Backend Service Architecture (#24)

This document is the foundation called out in issue #24: a documented
backend scaffold with explicit boundaries between the public API,
event-ingestion path, and worker runtime, plus the schema/migration story
that supports issues #13 and #14 without inventing a new platform later.

## Service boundaries

   └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The three concerns are intentionally co-located in one repo but kept
in distinct modules so they can be split into separate processes (or
horizontally scaled independently) later without rewriting the data model:

- **API surface** — `src/routes/*` + `src/app.ts`. Pure Fastify handlers.
  Validates with Zod (`src/schemas/*`), delegates to `LedgerService`,
  serializes through a single `serialize()` helper for stable response
  shapes.
- **Indexing inbound** — `POST /internal/reconcile` is the *only* write
  path the event indexer (issue #13) touches. Authenticated by
  `X-Internal-Secret` (`AppDeps.internalSecret`). The handler delegates
  straight into `LedgerService.reconcileEvent`, which is replay-safe
  (event-first writes go to `PendingEvent` and are claimed when the
  intent eventually attaches its `tx_hash`).
- **Worker runtime** — `src/cron.ts` schedules the reconciler sweep and
  the orphan TTL eviction. Worker concerns never reach into route
  handlers; they call `LedgerService` directly so they share the same
  invariants as the API.

## Domain model

| Table | Purpose | Key columns |
|---|---|---|
| `action_ledger` | Intent record. Created the moment a user clicks a button, before any tx is signed. | `idempotency_key` (unique), `wallet_address`, `action_type`, `status`, `tx_hash`, `correlation_id`, `error_code`, `redacted_at` |
| `pending_events` | Indexer-first events that arrived before the matching intent attached its `tx_hash`. Drained on attach. | `tx_hash` (PK), `soroban_event_id`, `event_payload`, `status_hint`, `consumed_at` |

Status machine (enforced in `src/constants.ts`):

```
pending  ──┬──► submitted ──┬──► confirmed
           │                ├──► reverted
           │                └──► orphaned   (TTL sweep — worker)
           └──► failed
```

The ledger never deletes rows. Privacy scrub (`DELETE /actions?wallet=…`)
nulls `action_payload` and sets `redacted_at`, preserving the audit
trail for the indexer.

### Why an intent-first ledger

An intent is durably recorded *before* the wallet signs anything, so:

- A wallet timeout / browser refresh can recover by replaying the
  `Idempotency-Key` rather than producing a duplicate on-chain tx.
- The indexer can publish events asynchronously without coordinating
  with the API process.
- The `correlation_id` is carried through every log line and structured
  error response so the frontend can quote it in support tickets.

## Migration strategy

Schema lives in `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`. Migrations live in
`backend/prisma/migrations/` and are applied with the standard Prisma
flow — `prisma migrate dev` locally, `prisma migrate deploy` in CI and
production. Rollback is purposely *not* automated: every migration is
expected to be additive (new tables, new columns, new enum values).
Destructive changes require a paired migration that keeps the previous
schema readable until traffic has cut over.

## Local-development bootstrap

```bash
cp .env.example .env                  # set DATABASE_URL, INTERNAL_SECRET
pnpm install
pnpm exec prisma migrate deploy       # applies migrations to your local DB
pnpm dev                              # starts Fastify on $PORT, default 3000
pnpm test                             # vitest + testcontainers (needs Docker)
```

The default `.env.example` points at a local Postgres at
`localhost:5432`. Tests spin up an ephemeral Postgres 16 container per
run (`tests/helpers/db.ts`), so contributors don't need to manage a
test database manually.

## Configuration

All env vars are validated at boot in `src/env.ts` via Zod. Boot fails
loudly with a structured Zod error if anything is missing or malformed.
Required values:

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection string. |
| `INTERNAL_SECRET` | Shared secret for `X-Internal-Secret` on `/internal/reconcile`. |
| `PORT` | HTTP port (optional, default 3000). |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Pino log level (`info`, `debug`, …). |

## Replay safety

`LedgerService.reconcileEvent` is the only path that writes a
confirmed/reverted status. It is wrapped in a Prisma transaction and
falls back to the `PendingEvent` table when the matching intent's
`tx_hash` has not yet been attached. The same transaction is invoked
from both the worker sweep and `POST /internal/reconcile`, so duplicate
deliveries from the indexer are idempotent.

## Smoke check

The repo ships a synchronous boot smoke test
(`tests/smoke.spec.ts`) that:

1. Boots the Fastify app with a Testcontainers Postgres instance
2. Applies the latest migrations via `prisma migrate deploy`
3. Asserts `/health` responds `200 { ok: true }`

Run it with `pnpm test -- smoke.spec.ts`. If this passes locally, the
backend stack is healthy enough for issues #13 and #14 to land work
against it.

## Relationship to the rest of the system

- **Frontend (#7, #14)** consumes only the public Fastify routes.
  Stale-data handling is driven by the `is_stale` flag returned from
  `GET /dashboard/summary`.
- **Soroban contracts (#10, #11, #12)** never call this service
  directly. Their events flow through the off-chain indexer (issue #13)
  and arrive here via `POST /internal/reconcile`.
- **Indexer (#13)** is the only producer of `PendingEvent` rows and the
  only authenticated caller of `/internal/reconcile`.
