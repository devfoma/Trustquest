Action ledger and reconciliation service for TrustQuest (issue #34).

## Stack

- Node 20 + TypeScript
- Fastify 4 (HTTP)
- Prisma 5 + Postgres 16 (storage)
- Zod (validation)
- Pino (logging)
- node-cron (orphan sweep)
- Vitest + Testcontainers (tests against real Postgres)

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
pnpm install
pnpm exec prisma migrate deploy
pnpm test
pnpm dev
```

## Endpoints

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-23-action-ledger-design.md` for the full contract, and [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the service layout, schema, worker runtime, and migration strategy.

## Environment

See `.env.example`. All values are validated at boot via Zod.

## Tests

Tests use Testcontainers to spin up Postgres 16 per run. Docker must be available.

```bash
pnpm test
```
